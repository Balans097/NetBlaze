Yes, from the 3 movies up to this point this one is the weakest, but that doesnt mean its bad. Yes, there are some moments in the story that feel weird, there are actually some plotpoints that are never adressed, it parodies itself a little bit too much, and etc. But the action is still pretty cool, the story while having its bunch of mistakes, its still very entertaining. I do hope more people appreciate it with the time.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

I like how the story connects with the previous movies and the how it tries to expand the Terminator universe. The characters themselves are compelling and the action is bigger, thrilling and almost on par with the previous movies. The acting department is also excellent with Arnold swarzenneger stealing the show once again. The villain is improved and also chilling. Overall, this film starts out really promising, holding your attention, it did begin to begin muddled in the somewhere in the last act, but that doesn't take away from the action and good characters.",

Terminator 3 lacks a visionary filmmaker and they include many needless jokes and winks to the fans. Schwarzenegger returns and saves what could've been an absolute mess without him. The film has some action packed moments, but it lacks the pacing of the first 2 films. It's not a mess, but it's not great either. Like all needless sequels, they attempt nostalgia to appease the core fans, and that is not what we want.",

Sure he's a bit whiny and a bit of a coward, but that's because he has not grown yet into the person he will be. He's unsure, and full of doubt. He has to grow.And this movie has one of the best movie trailers I've ever seen!",

      "date": "Aug 31, 2003",
      "dateTimestamp": 1770728274,
      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

      "text": "7/10Good, and respectful of the originalsI liked this movie. It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

It's the least of the three terminators, yes. But the least in a series of such high quality and entertainment value that to suggest this is one of the worst sequels ever is just plain hyperbolic stupidity. One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects. Get over your butthurt fanboy gripes and just enjoy it.",

However, for this 3rd installment, a little laziness and money driven dynamics is at work here. The allure of quality of the theme is diluted and not brought out. There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it. Good sci-fi has to be respected if one wants in for the hall of fame spots. For the popcorn and money making, this one performs well-enough. You have to see it to judge it making you a...",

However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

The characters themselves are compelling and the action is bigger, thrilling and almost on par with the previous movies. The acting department is also excellent with Arnold swarzenneger stealing the show once again. The villain is improved and also chilling. Overall, this film starts out really promising, holding your attention, it did begin to begin muddled in the somewhere in the last act, but that doesn't take away from the action and good characters.",

The film has some action packed moments, but it lacks the pacing of the first 2 films. It's not a mess, but it's not great either.

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

It's the least of the three terminators, yes.

One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects. Get over your butthurt fanboy gripes and just enjoy it.",

However, for this 3rd installment, a little laziness and money driven dynamics is at work here. The allure of quality of the theme is diluted and not brought out. There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it. Good sci-fi has to be respected if one wants in for the hall of fame spots. For the popcorn and money making, this one performs well-enough. You have to see it to judge it making you a...",

However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

      "text": "7/10Good, and respectful of the originalsI liked this movie. It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects.

There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it.

Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

      "text": "6/10Unwanted parody of two of cinemas finest action filmsNo matter what people say Terminator 3 was a turkey.The tone was wrong and bad decisions were made in the casting and character phase of the film.Sarah Conner is feebly written out of this story and the film suffers badly for missing her presence.There is also too much self referential parody,there are times when Arnie is made to look silly through the use of badly timed and misjudged comedy moments.I partly blame Jonathan Mostow,he held the reigns on this one and would have had a big say in how it all played out.I couldn't believe they went as far to copy the scene in T2 when Arnie gets his leathers in the bar only this time he gets them from a gay bar and ends up wearing 70's style plastic Elton John style glitz glasses instead of his iconic shades.This was embarrassing.Ed Furlong is replaced by the inferior Nick Stahl and Clare Danes is just filler. The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

I like how the story connects with the previous movies and the how it tries to expand the Terminator universe. The characters themselves are compelling and the action is bigger, thrilling and almost on par with the previous movies. The acting department is also excellent with Arnold swarzenneger stealing the show once again. The villain is improved and also chilling. Overall, this film starts out really promising, holding your attention, it did begin to begin muddled in the somewhere in the last act, but that doesn't take away from the action and good characters.",

Terminator 3 lacks a visionary filmmaker and they include many needless jokes and winks to the fans. Schwarzenegger returns and saves what could've been an absolute mess without him. The film has some action packed moments, but it lacks the pacing of the first 2 films. It's not a mess, but it's not great either. Like all needless sequels, they attempt nostalgia to appease the core fans, and that is not what we want.",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects. Get over your butthurt fanboy gripes and just enjoy it.",

However, for this 3rd installment, a little laziness and money driven dynamics is at work here. The allure of quality of the theme is diluted and not brought out. There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it. Good sci-fi has to be respected if one wants in for the hall of fame spots. For the popcorn and money making, this one performs well-enough. You have to see it to judge it making you a...",

However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

The characters themselves are compelling and the action is bigger, thrilling and almost on par with the previous movies. The acting department is also excellent with Arnold swarzenneger stealing the show once again. The villain is improved and also chilling.

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects.

There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it.

However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

      "text": "7/10Good Conclusion to the SagaI think this movie is a little underrated. Is it as good as T2? No, definitely not. But what film really is? With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

It's the least of the three terminators, yes. But the least in a series of such high quality and entertainment value that to suggest this is one of the worst sequels ever is just plain hyperbolic stupidity. One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects. Get over your butthurt fanboy gripes and just enjoy it.",

However, for this 3rd installment, a little laziness and money driven dynamics is at work here. The allure of quality of the theme is diluted and not brought out. There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it. Good sci-fi has to be respected if one wants in for the hall of fame spots. For the popcorn and money making, this one performs well-enough. You have to see it to judge it making you a...",

However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

Terminator 3 lacks a visionary filmmaker and they include many needless jokes and winks to the fans. Schwarzenegger returns and saves what could've been an absolute mess without him. The film has some action packed moments, but it lacks the pacing of the first 2 films. It's not a mess, but it's not great either. Like all needless sequels, they attempt nostalgia to appease the core fans, and that is not what we want.",

But that doesn't make this a bad film. I actually like how John Connor is portrayed in this. Sure he's a bit whiny and a bit of a coward, but that's because he has not grown yet into the person he will be. He's unsure, and full of doubt. He has to grow.And this movie has one of the best movie trailers I've ever seen!",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two.

Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

Yes, from the 3 movies up to this point this one is the weakest, but that doesnt mean its bad. Yes, there are some moments in the story that feel weird, there are actually some plotpoints that are never adressed, it parodies itself a little bit too much, and etc. But the action is still pretty cool, the story while having its bunch of mistakes, its still very entertaining. I do hope more people appreciate it with the time.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

The characters themselves are compelling and the action is bigger, thrilling and almost on par with the previous movies. The acting department is also excellent with Arnold swarzenneger stealing the show once again. The villain is improved and also chilling. Overall, this film starts out really promising, holding your attention, it did begin to begin muddled in the somewhere in the last act, but that doesn't take away from the action and good characters.",

Terminator 3 lacks a visionary filmmaker and they include many needless jokes and winks to the fans. Schwarzenegger returns and saves what could've been an absolute mess without him. The film has some action packed moments, but it lacks the pacing of the first 2 films. It's not a mess, but it's not great either. Like all needless sequels, they attempt nostalgia to appease the core fans, and that is not what we want.",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

It's the least of the three terminators, yes. But the least in a series of such high quality and entertainment value that to suggest this is one of the worst sequels ever is just plain hyperbolic stupidity. One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects. Get over your butthurt fanboy gripes and just enjoy it.",

However, for this 3rd installment, a little laziness and money driven dynamics is at work here. The allure of quality of the theme is diluted and not brought out. There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it. Good sci-fi has to be respected if one wants in for the hall of fame spots. For the popcorn and money making, this one performs well-enough. You have to see it to judge it making you a...",

However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

It's the least of the three terminators, yes.

One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects.

However, for this 3rd installment, a little laziness and money driven dynamics is at work here. The allure of quality of the theme is diluted and not brought out. There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it. Good sci-fi has to be respected if one wants in for the hall of fame spots. For the popcorn and money making, this one performs well-enough. You have to see it to judge it making you a...",

However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

      "text": "7/10Good, and respectful of the originalsI liked this movie. It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects.

There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it.

Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

      "text": "6/10Unwanted parody of two of cinemas finest action filmsNo matter what people say Terminator 3 was a turkey.The tone was wrong and bad decisions were made in the casting and character phase of the film.Sarah Conner is feebly written out of this story and the film suffers badly for missing her presence.There is also too much self referential parody,there are times when Arnie is made to look silly through the use of badly timed and misjudged comedy moments.I partly blame Jonathan Mostow,he held the reigns on this one and would have had a big say in how it all played out.I couldn't believe they went as far to copy the scene in T2 when Arnie gets his leathers in the bar only this time he gets them from a gay bar and ends up wearing 70's style plastic Elton John style glitz glasses instead of his iconic shades.This was embarrassing.Ed Furlong is replaced by the inferior Nick Stahl and Clare Danes is just filler. The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

I like how the story connects with the previous movies and the how it tries to expand the Terminator universe. The characters themselves are compelling and the action is bigger, thrilling and almost on par with the previous movies. The acting department is also excellent with Arnold swarzenneger stealing the show once again. The villain is improved and also chilling. Overall, this film starts out really promising, holding your attention, it did begin to begin muddled in the somewhere in the last act, but that doesn't take away from the action and good characters.",

Terminator 3 lacks a visionary filmmaker and they include many needless jokes and winks to the fans. Schwarzenegger returns and saves what could've been an absolute mess without him. The film has some action packed moments, but it lacks the pacing of the first 2 films. It's not a mess, but it's not great either. Like all needless sequels, they attempt nostalgia to appease the core fans, and that is not what we want.",

Sure he's a bit whiny and a bit of a coward, but that's because he has not grown yet into the person he will be. He's unsure, and full of doubt. He has to grow.And this movie has one of the best movie trailers I've ever seen!",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

However, for this 3rd installment, a little laziness and money driven dynamics is at work here. The allure of quality of the theme is diluted and not brought out. There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it. Good sci-fi has to be respected if one wants in for the hall of fame spots. For the popcorn and money making, this one performs well-enough. You have to see it to judge it making you a...",

However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

The characters themselves are compelling and the action is bigger, thrilling and almost on par with the previous movies. The acting department is also excellent with Arnold swarzenneger stealing the show once again. The villain is improved and also chilling.

The film has some action packed moments, but it lacks the pacing of the first 2 films. It's not a mess, but it's not great either.

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

It's the least of the three terminators, yes.

One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects.

However, for this 3rd installment, a little laziness and money driven dynamics is at work here. The allure of quality of the theme is diluted and not brought out. There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it.

However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

      "text": "7/10Good Conclusion to the SagaI think this movie is a little underrated. Is it as good as T2? No, definitely not. But what film really is? With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

It's the least of the three terminators, yes.

One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects. Get over your butthurt fanboy gripes and just enjoy it.",

However, for this 3rd installment, a little laziness and money driven dynamics is at work here. The allure of quality of the theme is diluted and not brought out. There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it. Good sci-fi has to be respected if one wants in for the hall of fame spots. For the popcorn and money making, this one performs well-enough. You have to see it to judge it making you a...",

However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

But that doesn't make this a bad film. I actually like how John Connor is portrayed in this. Sure he's a bit whiny and a bit of a coward, but that's because he has not grown yet into the person he will be. He's unsure, and full of doubt. He has to grow.And this movie has one of the best movie trailers I've ever seen!",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

      "text": "7/10Good, and respectful of the originalsI liked this movie. It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it.

Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

Yes, there are some moments in the story that feel weird, there are actually some plotpoints that are never adressed, it parodies itself a little bit too much, and etc. But the action is still pretty cool, the story while having its bunch of mistakes, its still very entertaining. I do hope more people appreciate it with the time.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

The characters themselves are compelling and the action is bigger, thrilling and almost on par with the previous movies. The acting department is also excellent with Arnold swarzenneger stealing the show once again. The villain is improved and also chilling. Overall, this film starts out really promising, holding your attention, it did begin to begin muddled in the somewhere in the last act, but that doesn't take away from the action and good characters.",

Terminator 3 lacks a visionary filmmaker and they include many needless jokes and winks to the fans. Schwarzenegger returns and saves what could've been an absolute mess without him. The film has some action packed moments, but it lacks the pacing of the first 2 films. It's not a mess, but it's not great either. Like all needless sequels, they attempt nostalgia to appease the core fans, and that is not what we want.",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

It's the least of the three terminators, yes. But the least in a series of such high quality and entertainment value that to suggest this is one of the worst sequels ever is just plain hyperbolic stupidity. One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects. Get over your butthurt fanboy gripes and just enjoy it.",

However, for this 3rd installment, a little laziness and money driven dynamics is at work here. The allure of quality of the theme is diluted and not brought out. There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it. Good sci-fi has to be respected if one wants in for the hall of fame spots. For the popcorn and money making, this one performs well-enough. You have to see it to judge it making you a...",

However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

I hope that more Terminator fans will now appreciate it after the recent awful sequels like Genisys (with the spelling error) and Dark Fate which destroyed the franchise.\nAnd as much as some people want to hate this movie, at least it didn't fail at the box office.\nBy the way, Kristanna Loken is an impressive terminator.

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

It's the least of the three terminators, yes.

One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects. Get over your butthurt fanboy gripes and just enjoy it.",

However, for this 3rd installment, a little laziness and money driven dynamics is at work here. The allure of quality of the theme is diluted and not brought out. There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it. Good sci-fi has to be respected if one wants in for the hall of fame spots. For the popcorn and money making, this one performs well-enough. You have to see it to judge it making you a...",

However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

      "text": "7/10Good, and respectful of the originalsI liked this movie. It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects.

There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it.

Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

      "text": "6/10Unwanted parody of two of cinemas finest action filmsNo matter what people say Terminator 3 was a turkey.The tone was wrong and bad decisions were made in the casting and character phase of the film.Sarah Conner is feebly written out of this story and the film suffers badly for missing her presence.There is also too much self referential parody,there are times when Arnie is made to look silly through the use of badly timed and misjudged comedy moments.I partly blame Jonathan Mostow,he held the reigns on this one and would have had a big say in how it all played out.I couldn't believe they went as far to copy the scene in T2 when Arnie gets his leathers in the bar only this time he gets them from a gay bar and ends up wearing 70's style plastic Elton John style glitz glasses instead of his iconic shades.This was embarrassing.Ed Furlong is replaced by the inferior Nick Stahl and Clare Danes is just filler. The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

I like how the story connects with the previous movies and the how it tries to expand the Terminator universe. The characters themselves are compelling and the action is bigger, thrilling and almost on par with the previous movies. The acting department is also excellent with Arnold swarzenneger stealing the show once again. The villain is improved and also chilling. Overall, this film starts out really promising, holding your attention, it did begin to begin muddled in the somewhere in the last act, but that doesn't take away from the action and good characters.",

Terminator 3 lacks a visionary filmmaker and they include many needless jokes and winks to the fans. Schwarzenegger returns and saves what could've been an absolute mess without him. The film has some action packed moments, but it lacks the pacing of the first 2 films. It's not a mess, but it's not great either. Like all needless sequels, they attempt nostalgia to appease the core fans, and that is not what we want.",

Sure he's a bit whiny and a bit of a coward, but that's because he has not grown yet into the person he will be. He's unsure, and full of doubt. He has to grow.And this movie has one of the best movie trailers I've ever seen!",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please.

However, for this 3rd installment, a little laziness and money driven dynamics is at work here. The allure of quality of the theme is diluted and not brought out. There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it. Good sci-fi has to be respected if one wants in for the hall of fame spots. For the popcorn and money making, this one performs well-enough. You have to see it to judge it making you a...",

However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

The characters themselves are compelling and the action is bigger, thrilling and almost on par with the previous movies. The acting department is also excellent with Arnold swarzenneger stealing the show once again. The villain is improved and also chilling.

The film has some action packed moments, but it lacks the pacing of the first 2 films. It's not a mess, but it's not great either.

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

It's the least of the three terminators, yes.

One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects.

However, for this 3rd installment, a little laziness and money driven dynamics is at work here. The allure of quality of the theme is diluted and not brought out. There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it.

However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

      "text": "7/10Good Conclusion to the SagaI think this movie is a little underrated. Is it as good as T2? No, definitely not. But what film really is? With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

It's the least of the three terminators, yes.

One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects. Get over your butthurt fanboy gripes and just enjoy it.",

However, for this 3rd installment, a little laziness and money driven dynamics is at work here. The allure of quality of the theme is diluted and not brought out. There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it. Good sci-fi has to be respected if one wants in for the hall of fame spots. For the popcorn and money making, this one performs well-enough. You have to see it to judge it making you a...",

However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

But that doesn't make this a bad film. I actually like how John Connor is portrayed in this. Sure he's a bit whiny and a bit of a coward, but that's because he has not grown yet into the person he will be. He's unsure, and full of doubt. He has to grow.And this movie has one of the best movie trailers I've ever seen!",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

      "text": "7/10Good, and respectful of the originalsI liked this movie. It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it.

Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

Yes, there are some moments in the story that feel weird, there are actually some plotpoints that are never adressed, it parodies itself a little bit too much, and etc. But the action is still pretty cool, the story while having its bunch of mistakes, its still very entertaining. I do hope more people appreciate it with the time.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

The characters themselves are compelling and the action is bigger, thrilling and almost on par with the previous movies. The acting department is also excellent with Arnold swarzenneger stealing the show once again. The villain is improved and also chilling. Overall, this film starts out really promising, holding your attention, it did begin to begin muddled in the somewhere in the last act, but that doesn't take away from the action and good characters.",

Terminator 3 lacks a visionary filmmaker and they include many needless jokes and winks to the fans. Schwarzenegger returns and saves what could've been an absolute mess without him. The film has some action packed moments, but it lacks the pacing of the first 2 films. It's not a mess, but it's not great either. Like all needless sequels, they attempt nostalgia to appease the core fans, and that is not what we want.",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

It's the least of the three terminators, yes. But the least in a series of such high quality and entertainment value that to suggest this is one of the worst sequels ever is just plain hyperbolic stupidity. One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects. Get over your butthurt fanboy gripes and just enjoy it.",

However, for this 3rd installment, a little laziness and money driven dynamics is at work here. The allure of quality of the theme is diluted and not brought out. There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it. Good sci-fi has to be respected if one wants in for the hall of fame spots. For the popcorn and money making, this one performs well-enough. You have to see it to judge it making you a...",

However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

I hope that more Terminator fans will now appreciate it after the recent awful sequels like Genisys (with the spelling error) and Dark Fate which destroyed the franchise.\nAnd as much as some people want to hate this movie, at least it didn't fail at the box office.\nBy the way, Kristanna Loken is an impressive terminator.

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

It's the least of the three terminators, yes.

One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects. Get over your butthurt fanboy gripes and just enjoy it.",

However, for this 3rd installment, a little laziness and money driven dynamics is at work here. The allure of quality of the theme is diluted and not brought out. There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it. Good sci-fi has to be respected if one wants in for the hall of fame spots. For the popcorn and money making, this one performs well-enough. You have to see it to judge it making you a...",

However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

      "text": "7/10Good, and respectful of the originalsI liked this movie. It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects.

There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it.

Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

      "text": "6/10Unwanted parody of two of cinemas finest action filmsNo matter what people say Terminator 3 was a turkey.The tone was wrong and bad decisions were made in the casting and character phase of the film.Sarah Conner is feebly written out of this story and the film suffers badly for missing her presence.There is also too much self referential parody,there are times when Arnie is made to look silly through the use of badly timed and misjudged comedy moments.I partly blame Jonathan Mostow,he held the reigns on this one and would have had a big say in how it all played out.I couldn't believe they went as far to copy the scene in T2 when Arnie gets his leathers in the bar only this time he gets them from a gay bar and ends up wearing 70's style plastic Elton John style glitz glasses instead of his iconic shades.This was embarrassing.Ed Furlong is replaced by the inferior Nick Stahl and Clare Danes is just filler. The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

I like how the story connects with the previous movies and the how it tries to expand the Terminator universe. The characters themselves are compelling and the action is bigger, thrilling and almost on par with the previous movies. The acting department is also excellent with Arnold swarzenneger stealing the show once again. The villain is improved and also chilling. Overall, this film starts out really promising, holding your attention, it did begin to begin muddled in the somewhere in the last act, but that doesn't take away from the action and good characters.",

Terminator 3 lacks a visionary filmmaker and they include many needless jokes and winks to the fans. Schwarzenegger returns and saves what could've been an absolute mess without him. The film has some action packed moments, but it lacks the pacing of the first 2 films. It's not a mess, but it's not great either. Like all needless sequels, they attempt nostalgia to appease the core fans, and that is not what we want.",

Sure he's a bit whiny and a bit of a coward, but that's because he has not grown yet into the person he will be. He's unsure, and full of doubt. He has to grow.And this movie has one of the best movie trailers I've ever seen!",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please.

However, for this 3rd installment, a little laziness and money driven dynamics is at work here. The allure of quality of the theme is diluted and not brought out. There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it. Good sci-fi has to be respected if one wants in for the hall of fame spots. For the popcorn and money making, this one performs well-enough. You have to see it to judge it making you a...",

However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

The characters themselves are compelling and the action is bigger, thrilling and almost on par with the previous movies. The acting department is also excellent with Arnold swarzenneger stealing the show once again. The villain is improved and also chilling.

The film has some action packed moments, but it lacks the pacing of the first 2 films. It's not a mess, but it's not great either.

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

It's the least of the three terminators, yes.

One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects.

However, for this 3rd installment, a little laziness and money driven dynamics is at work here. The allure of quality of the theme is diluted and not brought out. There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it.

However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

      "text": "7/10Good Conclusion to the SagaI think this movie is a little underrated. Is it as good as T2? No, definitely not. But what film really is? With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

It's the least of the three terminators, yes.

One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects. Get over your butthurt fanboy gripes and just enjoy it.",

However, for this 3rd installment, a little laziness and money driven dynamics is at work here. The allure of quality of the theme is diluted and not brought out. There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it. Good sci-fi has to be respected if one wants in for the hall of fame spots. For the popcorn and money making, this one performs well-enough. You have to see it to judge it making you a...",

However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

But that doesn't make this a bad film. I actually like how John Connor is portrayed in this. Sure he's a bit whiny and a bit of a coward, but that's because he has not grown yet into the person he will be. He's unsure, and full of doubt. He has to grow.And this movie has one of the best movie trailers I've ever seen!",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

      "text": "7/10Good, and respectful of the originalsI liked this movie. It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it.

Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

Yes, there are some moments in the story that feel weird, there are actually some plotpoints that are never adressed, it parodies itself a little bit too much, and etc. But the action is still pretty cool, the story while having its bunch of mistakes, its still very entertaining. I do hope more people appreciate it with the time.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

The characters themselves are compelling and the action is bigger, thrilling and almost on par with the previous movies. The acting department is also excellent with Arnold swarzenneger stealing the show once again. The villain is improved and also chilling. Overall, this film starts out really promising, holding your attention, it did begin to begin muddled in the somewhere in the last act, but that doesn't take away from the action and good characters.",

Terminator 3 lacks a visionary filmmaker and they include many needless jokes and winks to the fans. Schwarzenegger returns and saves what could've been an absolute mess without him. The film has some action packed moments, but it lacks the pacing of the first 2 films. It's not a mess, but it's not great either. Like all needless sequels, they attempt nostalgia to appease the core fans, and that is not what we want.",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

It's the least of the three terminators, yes. But the least in a series of such high quality and entertainment value that to suggest this is one of the worst sequels ever is just plain hyperbolic stupidity. One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects. Get over your butthurt fanboy gripes and just enjoy it.",

However, for this 3rd installment, a little laziness and money driven dynamics is at work here. The allure of quality of the theme is diluted and not brought out. There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it. Good sci-fi has to be respected if one wants in for the hall of fame spots. For the popcorn and money making, this one performs well-enough. You have to see it to judge it making you a...",

However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

I hope that more Terminator fans will now appreciate it after the recent awful sequels like Genisys (with the spelling error) and Dark Fate which destroyed the franchise.\nAnd as much as some people want to hate this movie, at least it didn't fail at the box office.\nBy the way, Kristanna Loken is an impressive terminator.

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

It's the least of the three terminators, yes.

One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects. Get over your butthurt fanboy gripes and just enjoy it.",

However, for this 3rd installment, a little laziness and money driven dynamics is at work here. The allure of quality of the theme is diluted and not brought out. There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it. Good sci-fi has to be respected if one wants in for the hall of fame spots. For the popcorn and money making, this one performs well-enough. You have to see it to judge it making you a...",

However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

      "text": "7/10Good, and respectful of the originalsI liked this movie. It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects.

There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it.

Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

      "text": "6/10Unwanted parody of two of cinemas finest action filmsNo matter what people say Terminator 3 was a turkey.The tone was wrong and bad decisions were made in the casting and character phase of the film.Sarah Conner is feebly written out of this story and the film suffers badly for missing her presence.There is also too much self referential parody,there are times when Arnie is made to look silly through the use of badly timed and misjudged comedy moments.I partly blame Jonathan Mostow,he held the reigns on this one and would have had a big say in how it all played out.I couldn't believe they went as far to copy the scene in T2 when Arnie gets his leathers in the bar only this time he gets them from a gay bar and ends up wearing 70's style plastic Elton John style glitz glasses instead of his iconic shades.This was embarrassing.Ed Furlong is replaced by the inferior Nick Stahl and Clare Danes is just filler. The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

I like how the story connects with the previous movies and the how it tries to expand the Terminator universe. The characters themselves are compelling and the action is bigger, thrilling and almost on par with the previous movies. The acting department is also excellent with Arnold swarzenneger stealing the show once again. The villain is improved and also chilling. Overall, this film starts out really promising, holding your attention, it did begin to begin muddled in the somewhere in the last act, but that doesn't take away from the action and good characters.",

Terminator 3 lacks a visionary filmmaker and they include many needless jokes and winks to the fans. Schwarzenegger returns and saves what could've been an absolute mess without him. The film has some action packed moments, but it lacks the pacing of the first 2 films. It's not a mess, but it's not great either. Like all needless sequels, they attempt nostalgia to appease the core fans, and that is not what we want.",

Sure he's a bit whiny and a bit of a coward, but that's because he has not grown yet into the person he will be. He's unsure, and full of doubt. He has to grow.And this movie has one of the best movie trailers I've ever seen!",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please.

However, for this 3rd installment, a little laziness and money driven dynamics is at work here. The allure of quality of the theme is diluted and not brought out. There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it. Good sci-fi has to be respected if one wants in for the hall of fame spots. For the popcorn and money making, this one performs well-enough. You have to see it to judge it making you a...",

However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

Yes, there are some moments in the story that feel weird, there are actually some plotpoints that are never adressed, it parodies itself a little bit too much, and etc. But the action is still pretty cool, the story while having its bunch of mistakes, its still very entertaining.

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

The characters themselves are compelling and the action is bigger, thrilling and almost on par with the previous movies. The acting department is also excellent with Arnold swarzenneger stealing the show once again. The villain is improved and also chilling.

The film has some action packed moments, but it lacks the pacing of the first 2 films. It's not a mess, but it's not great either.

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

It's the least of the three terminators, yes.

One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects.

However, for this 3rd installment, a little laziness and money driven dynamics is at work here. The allure of quality of the theme is diluted and not brought out. There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it.

However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

      "text": "7/10Good Conclusion to the SagaI think this movie is a little underrated. Is it as good as T2? No, definitely not. But what film really is? With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

It's the least of the three terminators, yes.

One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects. Get over your butthurt fanboy gripes and just enjoy it.",

However, for this 3rd installment, a little laziness and money driven dynamics is at work here. The allure of quality of the theme is diluted and not brought out. There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it. Good sci-fi has to be respected if one wants in for the hall of fame spots. For the popcorn and money making, this one performs well-enough. You have to see it to judge it making you a...",

However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

But that doesn't make this a bad film. I actually like how John Connor is portrayed in this. Sure he's a bit whiny and a bit of a coward, but that's because he has not grown yet into the person he will be. He's unsure, and full of doubt. He has to grow.And this movie has one of the best movie trailers I've ever seen!",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

      "text": "7/10Good, and respectful of the originalsI liked this movie. It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please.

There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it.

Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

Yes, there are some moments in the story that feel weird, there are actually some plotpoints that are never adressed, it parodies itself a little bit too much, and etc. But the action is still pretty cool, the story while having its bunch of mistakes, its still very entertaining. I do hope more people appreciate it with the time.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

The characters themselves are compelling and the action is bigger, thrilling and almost on par with the previous movies. The acting department is also excellent with Arnold swarzenneger stealing the show once again. The villain is improved and also chilling. Overall, this film starts out really promising, holding your attention, it did begin to begin muddled in the somewhere in the last act, but that doesn't take away from the action and good characters.",

Terminator 3 lacks a visionary filmmaker and they include many needless jokes and winks to the fans. Schwarzenegger returns and saves what could've been an absolute mess without him. The film has some action packed moments, but it lacks the pacing of the first 2 films. It's not a mess, but it's not great either. Like all needless sequels, they attempt nostalgia to appease the core fans, and that is not what we want.",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

It's the least of the three terminators, yes. But the least in a series of such high quality and entertainment value that to suggest this is one of the worst sequels ever is just plain hyperbolic stupidity. One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects. Get over your butthurt fanboy gripes and just enjoy it.",

However, for this 3rd installment, a little laziness and money driven dynamics is at work here. The allure of quality of the theme is diluted and not brought out. There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it. Good sci-fi has to be respected if one wants in for the hall of fame spots. For the popcorn and money making, this one performs well-enough. You have to see it to judge it making you a...",

However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

I hope that more Terminator fans will now appreciate it after the recent awful sequels like Genisys (with the spelling error) and Dark Fate which destroyed the franchise.\nAnd as much as some people want to hate this movie, at least it didn't fail at the box office.\nBy the way, Kristanna Loken is an impressive terminator.

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

It's the least of the three terminators, yes.

One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects. Get over your butthurt fanboy gripes and just enjoy it.",

However, for this 3rd installment, a little laziness and money driven dynamics is at work here. The allure of quality of the theme is diluted and not brought out. There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it. Good sci-fi has to be respected if one wants in for the hall of fame spots. For the popcorn and money making, this one performs well-enough. You have to see it to judge it making you a...",

However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

      "text": "7/10Good, and respectful of the originalsI liked this movie. It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects.

There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it.

Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

      "text": "6/10Unwanted parody of two of cinemas finest action filmsNo matter what people say Terminator 3 was a turkey.The tone was wrong and bad decisions were made in the casting and character phase of the film.Sarah Conner is feebly written out of this story and the film suffers badly for missing her presence.There is also too much self referential parody,there are times when Arnie is made to look silly through the use of badly timed and misjudged comedy moments.I partly blame Jonathan Mostow,he held the reigns on this one and would have had a big say in how it all played out.I couldn't believe they went as far to copy the scene in T2 when Arnie gets his leathers in the bar only this time he gets them from a gay bar and ends up wearing 70's style plastic Elton John style glitz glasses instead of his iconic shades.This was embarrassing.Ed Furlong is replaced by the inferior Nick Stahl and Clare Danes is just filler. The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

I like how the story connects with the previous movies and the how it tries to expand the Terminator universe. The characters themselves are compelling and the action is bigger, thrilling and almost on par with the previous movies. The acting department is also excellent with Arnold swarzenneger stealing the show once again. The villain is improved and also chilling. Overall, this film starts out really promising, holding your attention, it did begin to begin muddled in the somewhere in the last act, but that doesn't take away from the action and good characters.",

Terminator 3 lacks a visionary filmmaker and they include many needless jokes and winks to the fans. Schwarzenegger returns and saves what could've been an absolute mess without him. The film has some action packed moments, but it lacks the pacing of the first 2 films. It's not a mess, but it's not great either. Like all needless sequels, they attempt nostalgia to appease the core fans, and that is not what we want.",

Sure he's a bit whiny and a bit of a coward, but that's because he has not grown yet into the person he will be. He's unsure, and full of doubt. He has to grow.And this movie has one of the best movie trailers I've ever seen!",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please.

However, for this 3rd installment, a little laziness and money driven dynamics is at work here. The allure of quality of the theme is diluted and not brought out. There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it. Good sci-fi has to be respected if one wants in for the hall of fame spots. For the popcorn and money making, this one performs well-enough. You have to see it to judge it making you a...",

However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

The characters themselves are compelling and the action is bigger, thrilling and almost on par with the previous movies. The acting department is also excellent with Arnold swarzenneger stealing the show once again. The villain is improved and also chilling.

The film has some action packed moments, but it lacks the pacing of the first 2 films. It's not a mess, but it's not great either.

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

It's the least of the three terminators, yes.

One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects.

However, for this 3rd installment, a little laziness and money driven dynamics is at work here. The allure of quality of the theme is diluted and not brought out. There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it.

However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

      "text": "7/10Good Conclusion to the SagaI think this movie is a little underrated. Is it as good as T2? No, definitely not. But what film really is? With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

It's the least of the three terminators, yes.

One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects. Get over your butthurt fanboy gripes and just enjoy it.",

However, for this 3rd installment, a little laziness and money driven dynamics is at work here. The allure of quality of the theme is diluted and not brought out. There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it. Good sci-fi has to be respected if one wants in for the hall of fame spots. For the popcorn and money making, this one performs well-enough. You have to see it to judge it making you a...",

However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

But that doesn't make this a bad film. I actually like how John Connor is portrayed in this. Sure he's a bit whiny and a bit of a coward, but that's because he has not grown yet into the person he will be. He's unsure, and full of doubt. He has to grow.And this movie has one of the best movie trailers I've ever seen!",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

      "text": "7/10Good, and respectful of the originalsI liked this movie. It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it.

Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

Yes, there are some moments in the story that feel weird, there are actually some plotpoints that are never adressed, it parodies itself a little bit too much, and etc. But the action is still pretty cool, the story while having its bunch of mistakes, its still very entertaining. I do hope more people appreciate it with the time.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

The characters themselves are compelling and the action is bigger, thrilling and almost on par with the previous movies. The acting department is also excellent with Arnold swarzenneger stealing the show once again. The villain is improved and also chilling. Overall, this film starts out really promising, holding your attention, it did begin to begin muddled in the somewhere in the last act, but that doesn't take away from the action and good characters.",

Terminator 3 lacks a visionary filmmaker and they include many needless jokes and winks to the fans. Schwarzenegger returns and saves what could've been an absolute mess without him. The film has some action packed moments, but it lacks the pacing of the first 2 films. It's not a mess, but it's not great either. Like all needless sequels, they attempt nostalgia to appease the core fans, and that is not what we want.",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

It's the least of the three terminators, yes. But the least in a series of such high quality and entertainment value that to suggest this is one of the worst sequels ever is just plain hyperbolic stupidity. One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects. Get over your butthurt fanboy gripes and just enjoy it.",

However, for this 3rd installment, a little laziness and money driven dynamics is at work here. The allure of quality of the theme is diluted and not brought out. There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it. Good sci-fi has to be respected if one wants in for the hall of fame spots. For the popcorn and money making, this one performs well-enough. You have to see it to judge it making you a...",

However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

I hope that more Terminator fans will now appreciate it after the recent awful sequels like Genisys (with the spelling error) and Dark Fate which destroyed the franchise.\nAnd as much as some people want to hate this movie, at least it didn't fail at the box office.\nBy the way, Kristanna Loken is an impressive terminator.

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

It's the least of the three terminators, yes.

One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects. Get over your butthurt fanboy gripes and just enjoy it.",

However, for this 3rd installment, a little laziness and money driven dynamics is at work here. The allure of quality of the theme is diluted and not brought out. There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it. Good sci-fi has to be respected if one wants in for the hall of fame spots. For the popcorn and money making, this one performs well-enough. You have to see it to judge it making you a...",

However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

      "text": "7/10Good, and respectful of the originalsI liked this movie. It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects.

There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it.

Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

      "text": "6/10Unwanted parody of two of cinemas finest action filmsNo matter what people say Terminator 3 was a turkey.The tone was wrong and bad decisions were made in the casting and character phase of the film.Sarah Conner is feebly written out of this story and the film suffers badly for missing her presence.There is also too much self referential parody,there are times when Arnie is made to look silly through the use of badly timed and misjudged comedy moments.I partly blame Jonathan Mostow,he held the reigns on this one and would have had a big say in how it all played out.I couldn't believe they went as far to copy the scene in T2 when Arnie gets his leathers in the bar only this time he gets them from a gay bar and ends up wearing 70's style plastic Elton John style glitz glasses instead of his iconic shades.This was embarrassing.Ed Furlong is replaced by the inferior Nick Stahl and Clare Danes is just filler. The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

I like how the story connects with the previous movies and the how it tries to expand the Terminator universe. The characters themselves are compelling and the action is bigger, thrilling and almost on par with the previous movies. The acting department is also excellent with Arnold swarzenneger stealing the show once again. The villain is improved and also chilling. Overall, this film starts out really promising, holding your attention, it did begin to begin muddled in the somewhere in the last act, but that doesn't take away from the action and good characters.",

Terminator 3 lacks a visionary filmmaker and they include many needless jokes and winks to the fans. Schwarzenegger returns and saves what could've been an absolute mess without him. The film has some action packed moments, but it lacks the pacing of the first 2 films. It's not a mess, but it's not great either. Like all needless sequels, they attempt nostalgia to appease the core fans, and that is not what we want.",

Sure he's a bit whiny and a bit of a coward, but that's because he has not grown yet into the person he will be. He's unsure, and full of doubt. He has to grow.And this movie has one of the best movie trailers I've ever seen!",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please.

However, for this 3rd installment, a little laziness and money driven dynamics is at work here. The allure of quality of the theme is diluted and not brought out. There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it. Good sci-fi has to be respected if one wants in for the hall of fame spots. For the popcorn and money making, this one performs well-enough. You have to see it to judge it making you a...",

However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

The characters themselves are compelling and the action is bigger, thrilling and almost on par with the previous movies. The acting department is also excellent with Arnold swarzenneger stealing the show once again. The villain is improved and also chilling.

The film has some action packed moments, but it lacks the pacing of the first 2 films. It's not a mess, but it's not great either.

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

It's the least of the three terminators, yes.

One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects.

However, for this 3rd installment, a little laziness and money driven dynamics is at work here. The allure of quality of the theme is diluted and not brought out. There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it.

However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

      "text": "7/10Good Conclusion to the SagaI think this movie is a little underrated. Is it as good as T2? No, definitely not. But what film really is? With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

It's the least of the three terminators, yes.

One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects. Get over your butthurt fanboy gripes and just enjoy it.",

However, for this 3rd installment, a little laziness and money driven dynamics is at work here. The allure of quality of the theme is diluted and not brought out. There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it. Good sci-fi has to be respected if one wants in for the hall of fame spots. For the popcorn and money making, this one performs well-enough. You have to see it to judge it making you a...",

However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

But that doesn't make this a bad film. I actually like how John Connor is portrayed in this. Sure he's a bit whiny and a bit of a coward, but that's because he has not grown yet into the person he will be. He's unsure, and full of doubt. He has to grow.And this movie has one of the best movie trailers I've ever seen!",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

      "text": "7/10Good, and respectful of the originalsI liked this movie. It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

      "text": "4/10Who cares!Have just returned after a triple show of T1 + T2 + T3. An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it.

Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",

Yes, there are some moments in the story that feel weird, there are actually some plotpoints that are never adressed, it parodies itself a little bit too much, and etc. But the action is still pretty cool, the story while having its bunch of mistakes, its still very entertaining. I do hope more people appreciate it with the time.",

      "text": "7/10A good, but flawed, attempt at continuing James Cameron's legacy.Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is often criticized by fans as being not in the same tone as its predecessors. While I agree with that statement in many ways, I think Jonathan Mostow made an honest effort to bookend the series.Storyline: The story is probably one of the things I take issue with most. It brings up new questions on the nature of time travel within the Terminator universe, as well as bringing new plot holes (something the previous films also had). Some of these flubs could've been corrected with a little research, but I digress.The story tends to be a retread of Terminator 2, which hurts it a lot. But Mostow tries to draw attention away from this with some awesome action sequences. The storyline, in this respect, takes it up a notch with scenes such as the restroom fight and crane scene.Acting: I think the acting is one of the best things in this film. Mostow did an excellent job in casting. Rather than going for actors known for their work in action films, the director instead used performers known for their talent in dramatic roles. Nick Stahl and Claire Danes both portray their characters with depth and humanity. Stahl does an especially good role in showing the paranoia and uncertainty of the future.And, as always, Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great job as the Terminator. His lack of social interaction provides many humorous moments throughout the film, while also giving him a drill instructor approach when dealing with the John Connor character.Lastly, there is Kristanna Loken as the T-X. While not as intimidating as the T-1000, I didn't expect this to be the case. Robert Patrick played a character with no face and every face, which can only work once if at all. That being said, Loken does a decent job in the role, providing a very cold performance for an equally cold character.Visual/Special Effects: The visuals of Terminator 3 are pretty good. The liquid metal effects are still as great as they were in 1991 along with some of the CG animated endoskeletons in the Future War sequence.My only qualms with the visuals is that there is a lack of blue tint that was prevalent in James Cameron's previous films, but this is more a matter of taste than anything.Musical Score: Brad Fiedel's dark and mechanical theme is absent from the film until the credits arrive, which is something that bothered me. Not only that, but T3's rendition of the theme isn't as powerful as it is in its predecessors. However, Marco Beltrami does manage to increase the tension of scenes with his score, though little else. This aspect, like the storyline, could of been improved.Conclusion: Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines wasn't a necessary sequel, but a decent one. I don't believe this installment ruined the series as much as, say, Alien^3. This film will no doubt continue to be one that either fans love or hate.I happen to love it.",

The Terminatrix doesn't really come off although Kristianna Loken tries her best.In all this is a hugely disappointing experience for people that have followed Terminator films so far.It has some great standalone action sequences but as a whole is a lazy retread that indulges parody and comedy far too much divorcing itself from the serious tone set by the previous two films.",

The characters themselves are compelling and the action is bigger, thrilling and almost on par with the previous movies. The acting department is also excellent with Arnold swarzenneger stealing the show once again. The villain is improved and also chilling. Overall, this film starts out really promising, holding your attention, it did begin to begin muddled in the somewhere in the last act, but that doesn't take away from the action and good characters.",

Terminator 3 lacks a visionary filmmaker and they include many needless jokes and winks to the fans. Schwarzenegger returns and saves what could've been an absolute mess without him. The film has some action packed moments, but it lacks the pacing of the first 2 films. It's not a mess, but it's not great either. Like all needless sequels, they attempt nostalgia to appease the core fans, and that is not what we want.",

      "text": "Not perfect but it is what a summer blockbuster should be  a big loud enjoyable filmIn 2003 John Connor is living a life without record, with no fixed address, no bank account and no permanent job. He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him. In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster. Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them. As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.T3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out. In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters. In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not. However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.The plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor. Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene. However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.The action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc. I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy. The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology. The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!The direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all. Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it. For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good. In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.The cast is roundly good. The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well. Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else. Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.Overall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do. The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time. The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending. I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch. Nor a great film but I really wish that more blockbusters were like this.",

It maybe isn't at the level of the first two, but it is decent enough, and respectful of the originals.The biggest plus of the movie, is what lot of people call it a minus: the fact that it reverses the \"happy end\"of T2. Sorry, but this is not \"disrespect to the Terminator canon\". On the contrary, it is respect to the original T1 story: Judgement Day is inevitable, one way or another. (Or at least the danger of it.) But we keep fighting. This is the main idea of the Terminator mythos, and it's good that T3 restores it, as it should always be.The biggest minus of the movie is something else: the character of John Connor, which, in the contrary with T2 movie (where he was an adventurous, clever and \"noughty\"(in a good way) boy we loved), here appears something of a crybaby young man, though at last seems he finds his way and destiny. And of course we miss our beloved Sarah Connor.On the contrary, the terminatrix Kristanna Lokken is superb at her role (though the Terminator model evolution, T-X, has reached an absurd level, as if liquid medal wasn't enough already). She has that cold look, and also expresses the \"female power\"thing. Her one-vs-one battles with good old Arnie are the best action moments of the movie.",

      "text": "8/10The more I think about this movie, the more it grows on me.I didn't go to see this movie with very high expectations, because it has gotten such varied and sometimes disparaging reviews this forum. However, since I am an aspiring screenwriter and true cinema fan rather than simply a moviegoer, I decided to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I could end up writing a scathing attack on it.Instead, I have found that I enjoyed the movie as I watched it, saw some flaws, but have discovered that the more I think about it, the more I want to give it a higher rating than I initially did (7). The film's two major dramatic flaws, in my opinion, are: (1) An over-the-top chase scene that comes way too early in the script without sufficient build-up in suspense leading up to it; (2) A little too much campy humor recycled from the first two Terminator movies.The good outweighs the bad by a large margin. (1) The screenplay has some intriguing plot subtleties that grow on me after awhile, the most notable of which is the actual nature of the safe place. It could be the way it is for several possible reasons, some strategically favoring SkyNet, some the humans. Any of them could be spun into a major plot element for a sequel. The rest you'll just have to find yourself. (2) The character development of both John Connor and Kate Brewster is elegant, believable and moving, and also opens possibilities for future character development. (3) The plot is an interesting variation of the \"Reluctant Hero\"theme, which is a classic in literature and drama and always will be. John Connor is a hero who is almost an anti-hero. True, they could have sharpened his ambivalence a little (sacrificing some chase footage for it would have been an excellent trade, in my opinion). (4) The Terminatrix is a very good villain: She's young, she's sexy, and she's chillingly soulless. She is actually too smoothly sexy and physically perfect, but that makes sense when you consider that she has been created and programmed by other machines who, lacking the real-world experience of humans, can only base her appearance and humanoid behavior on their knowledge of human stereotypes.That last leads me to some thoughts about Arnie's character. He is clearly getting a little too old for a reprise of his customary youthful, physically perfect role in any sequel. If he is brought back in a sequel - and I hope he is - a good, imaginative screenwriter could really work with his advancing age and loss of physical perfection. Since he is programmed by humans with real human experience, he could be brought back as a deceptively older and less physically powerful character, but more psychologically sophisticated (more like a true human with a soul), and his deceptive physical appearance combined with his greater psychological sophistication could be his aces in the hole when his strength and nonhuman cyborg qualities are insufficient. In other words, he could be shaped into an amazing supporting hero in any sequel. Maybe I could write his role!",

With that out of way I'd say the third installment of the series is still a good action movie and unlike it's successors further down the line stays true to its heritage.The one thing which this film does better than T2 is the ending in my opinion. Did you really think the destruction of one computer lab would prevent humanity from developing AI forever? This wasn't really all that believable, time paradoxes not even factored in. T3 brings everything much more to full circle which I appreciate. Also I admit that I do have a soft spot for a hot terminatrix clad in red leather.It's a shame how the franchise went downhill after this, though. With Salvation being a completely disconnected but still somewhat okay action movie, Genesys a half backed and ultimately failed attempt at a soft reboot and Dark Fate an other reboot attempt that is outright insulting to the fans.",

      "text": "6/10Somehow turns out to be one of the more successful sequels to this franchiseI remember vividly watching this movie in the cinema, I also remember how exited I was. I was brought up on the first 2 terminator movies, they were movies that alongside a handful of westerns me and my dad would bond over. He has sadly since passed but I even remember the excitement he had knowing a third installment was on its way. My dad was at this point to ill to go to the cinema with me, so I actually took a past girlfriend with me, who was not thrilled to be watching a action movie. By the end of it she wasn't the only one not thrilled.Look it's not a bad movie, in fact as the years have passed, I reluctantly have grown to praise it somewhat, but it's so disappointing knowing this was the movie that followed the absolute classic T2. After watching it in the cinema, I remember being visibly annoyed by the experience, it felt campy and outdated even in 2003. Yet if you have watched all the sequels following this, then it's hard not to argue, it's one of the better ones.The movie still annoys me, I'll be honest about that but not the same way it used to, I've grown somewhat to understand why this movie was always going to ultimately fail for most fans. The problem was, post the 80s and 90s, teen movies had started dominating the cinemas. It was rare that adults would line up to watch movies anymore, it was teens. So the producers and filmmakers wanted that audience for this movie, so this was made for PG-13, problem is it dumbs down the whole movie.I think what studios fail to remember is that regardless what certificate a movie is, if someone wants to watch a movie, they are going to find a way. I knew kids as young as 10 in my childhood days that absolutely loved the Terminator. Half of the fun was watching these adult action movies, it made us feel grown up.This movie feels like it was made for 12 year olds and not adults. The story is over simplistic, the dialogue is often corny and the special effects and action scenes are just generic and what we see in every other action movie. The whole movie just feels dumbed down, even the casting of Loken as the new Terminator felt like a move to please teenage boys.A movie, any movie, primary goal should just to be make a effective story come to life on screen, it it's a action movie, get the best stuntmen, create the best thing you're imagination can come up with, but always put the story and characters first. This movie did not do that.Not to say it's all bad, while the effects didn't really impress me even in 2003, it does have a few good action orientated scenes including a dozer smashing Arnie quite literally through a building. Talking about Arnie, other than being given some cheesy dialogue, it was still a great experience watching the actor back in this role.I can't quite praise Nick Stahl tho, I understand that he was trying to put his own touch on the John Connor character, but the template that Edward Furlong created for this character was not expanded upon. The kid with built up rage just looking for a role model in his life, turned out to be a annoying wimp. It just don't feel like that character.For a teen action movie, I'd say yeah it's great. And at worse, in my opinion, it at least deserves a watch. But this is absolutely nothing compared to the two previous installments.",

An excellent way in which to spend a rainy day!Before the films my three friends and I were looking very much forward to re-see T1 + T2 on a big screen. As for T3 we didn't expect too much.While the copies of T1 + T2 were slightly dated, to say the least, both films were absolutely superb, also despite the fact that the effects in T1 were quite primitive compared to today. Nevertheless, T1 remained our favorite not the least because of its very stringent and no-nonsense non-moralistic narrative. T2 was also strong in this aspect, though there were slightly more plot holes and a little too much sentimentality, something which unfortunately plagues many American films. Nonetheless T2 is also great.Then came T3 ... well, a film taste is very individual. Therefore you, dear reader, should not be deterred from going to see this film, despite the fact that my three friends and I all couldn't care less about it.Why didn't we like it? Well, surprisingly we were all in agreement about the lack-of-Cameron-touch as one of the worst failings of the film. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.Therefore the new director tries to make up for this deficiency in making the car chases and the explosions bigger, the new enemy T-X more deadly, and destruction more extreme. But it all lacks energy, soul and credibility. The narrative is messy and coincidental, as if the director thinks \"now it will be nice to have this scene from a previous Terminator film included and just beefed up\"or \"let's try this - it might be funny\". This unfortunately lets the actors down, leaving them with empty hulls and we couldn't care less if they die or live. This, incidentally, is comparable to the Matrix II and the new Star Wars films. The director believes that he has a good film if he/she can include some cool effects. Doesn't work, though! Furthermore, the scenes lack anything that might even remotely draw the audience into the film. While you can feel the anguish of the humans and the one-mindedness of the robots in the earlier films, this piece of junk left my friends and I with the feeling of \"who cares!\"The first and second Hellraiser movies were absolutely splendid. However, what followed should not ever be mentioned anywhere - especially number three sucked big time and should never bee seen by anybody. Terminator 3 is not so bad that it shouldn't be seen, though. However, it is highly advisable that you lower any expectations - and the lower them again. Then you might enjoy this film. Alternatively wait for the cheap version of the DVD. Finally, if the studio really wants to make a T4, which is highly suggested in T3, then they better get Cameron back on the job. Otherwise they will have just another silly action flick, with no real innovation or originality on their hands, like a gazillion other action flicks from Hollywood - because this is what they have with T3. So unless they rediscover the respect they owe to the great old Terminator-films : Who cares!",

      "text": "8/10Why the Hate?I truly don't get the hate for this movie, unless you're one of those types that goes to comicon and asks questions about insanely obscure trivia to flaunt your vast knowledge of the T universe or writes erotic terminator fan-fiction from your mom's basement. It's the least of the three terminators, yes. But the least in a series of such high quality and entertainment value that to suggest this is one of the worst sequels ever is just plain hyperbolic stupidity. One of the things I keep seeing mentioned is the less serious parts. What is wrong with some humor? It was hardly even close to enough to call it a comedy and none of it was bad enough to induce groans. T2, and even T1, had humorous bits but I don't hear complaints about them. I don't know what people were expecting. They act like this is the Phantom Menace of the Terminator franchise. Please. It's got solid action (including one of the best destructive car chase sequences ever imho), it's exciting, it's got decent acting and effects. Get over your butthurt fanboy gripes and just enjoy it.",

      "text": "6/10Rise of the ViewerWho doesn't like the Terminator storyline? The original blew our minds and the follow up the same. However, for this 3rd installment, a little laziness and money driven dynamics is at work here. The allure of quality of the theme is diluted and not brought out. There are long-drawn out scenes and scenes under-developed. There is so much one can do with a super robot that just doesn't surface here. Also, the human parts lack depth and development. This is more of a mathematical movie meaning return on investment than a memorable one. Too bad too but only for the viewer. Everyone else made a buck or two. One gets the felling of being rushed while watching and not slowed down enough to sip a scene for depth. The thrill and action sequences were over the top and while this is allowed, these scenes ran too long and took away from the movie not added to it. Good sci-fi has to be respected if one wants in for the hall of fame spots. For the popcorn and money making, this one performs well-enough. You have to see it to judge it making you a...",

      "text": "Pretty awful.Judged on its own merits, this movie is as forgettable as a thousand other forgettable action flicks: They come, stick around for a few weeks and they're gone. Who cares. However, judged in relation to T1 and T2, this movie is especially bad.Here are a few of the things that bugged me: Whereas the earlier movies were thought provoking, this was just action for the sake of action. Even as such it wasn't all that good. T1 and T2 had elements of real heroism in them. Here we have no one to look up to. It amazes me that even though this movie was made much more recently, aided by the latest digital technology, it just didn't look as good as either of the previous two: They had a certain realism about them (keeping in mind that these are fantasy movies) whereas T3, at times, had more of a comic book movie look, reminding me at certain points of Batman or Darkman. The early fight scene outside the animal clinic looked particularly bad, as if it were done on a soundstage (probably was). The acting wasn't very good. I felt kind of bad for Claire Danes whom otherwise I like. I agree with some of the other reviews, John Connor was rather irritatingly wimpy. Arnold looked a little too old and the sunglasses gag was wrong for the movie. TX did nothing for me. The design detail was not nearly as good as T2.And so on. 2/10.",
